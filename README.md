# world-cup-winner-2022 [WIP]
 
 This one is a project you can predict who the next world cup winner will be. 
 
 This code is originally built in Python by Digital Innovation One (https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/live-coding-evitando-o-7x1-com-python-e-sql), at first I thought it was a great idea but I thought about how I could make it more unique, so I came up with the idea of building it with an interative interface, so here it is.

 I've transformed the whole code from Python to JS.
